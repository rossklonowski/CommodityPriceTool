# Commodity Price Tool
## Background
My group mates Jaret Helminski, and Jacob Schandel designed an application to submit for our Computer Networks Class. 
The purpose of this program is to demonstrate how via an API, you can modify and read updates in a database.
## Description
A price tool to monitor commodity prices in your local town. Currently, Soy Beans, Corn, and Wheat prices are monitored.
Updates to the prices are updated by the users of the app alone.
